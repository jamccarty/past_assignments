Reflection:
===========
    This assignment went far more smoothly than last week's (thank you). I feel like I have a pretty good
    understanding of heaps now, to the point where I wish I'd known about them earlier (as I think they
    could have proved very useful on some of the past assignments). I ran into a bit of trouble with inheritance
    as some of the functions would call BinaryHeap's size and backArray, and some would call TernaryHeap's -- which
    led to a variety of problems including but not limited to me thinking my offer() method wasn't working when it 
    actually was, me thinking the offer() method WAS working but something was spontaneously deleting it before I 
    could peek() at backArray's contents, and me thinking I'd somehow screwed up extending the class so that it
    couldn't actually call super methods -- but switching BinaryHeap.size and BinaryHeap.backArray to protected 
    instance variables rather than private ones managed to resolve all of these.

    Who is Jane? Is this another reference to an 80s movie? I tried googling the phrase, but uh. The results
    were not very helpful.
