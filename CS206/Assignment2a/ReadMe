Programs Files:
===============
    Part 1: 
        Place.java, Places.java, uszipcodes.csv

How to Compile:
===============
    Part 1:
        javac Place.java
    Part 2:
        javac Places.java

How to Run:
===========
    Part 1:
        java Place
    Part 2:
        java Places (contains main method)

Reflection:
===========
    I feel this project went fairly well. There was a brief
    hiccup where it appeared to crash for no reason when it
    had previously run (and when there had been no additional 
    changes made), but this was resolved by restarting my computer
    and has not reoccurred since. This assignment helped me in 
    gaining a greater understanding of the various merits of
    throwing exceptions rather than just catching them then and there,
    which I appreciate, as I did not understand why someone would throw 
    when catching in-method was an option. The part I struggled with 
    the most was creating a method of exiting the program. At first, I was
    going to create a question prompt after every searched zip code, in which
    the terminal would prompt the user to answer with y or n on whether or not
    they would like to continue. However, I ran into difficulties when 
    many of my attempts resulted in infinite loops or simply not running the loop
    at all, so I ultimately decided it would be simpler to just include an 'exit'
    condition.

I Worked With:
==============
    Bailey Hirota (bhirota) and I discussed strategies for handling exceptions
    and in-line comments.

Approximate Hours Worked:
=========================
    A little under 4 hours.

Special instructions to the grader:
===================================
    None.

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    As mentioned before, this code did crash for unknown reasons.
    This was resolved by restarting my computer and has not reoccured,
    so I am fairly confident it will not happen again.
