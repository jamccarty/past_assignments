Reflection:
===========
    This assignment was quite a bit harder for me than last week's. This was largely due to my 
    overall inexperience working with ArrayLists as a data structure; however, I also ran into 
    difficulties sorting the data from the .csv file. The shortest location inputs
    (the ones missing population, latitude, and longitude) kept on reading as the same length
    as the locations missing only population. I finally resolved this by just specifying that 
    the short locations would have two empty slots in their array -- that way I could accurately judge
    which locations would create a Place (as opposed to a LocatedPlace or PopulatedPlace). Similarly,
    I ran into an issue with determining when the file length ended. I had to go to a TA session to
    figure it out, but it turned out I had just forgotten one of the String methods specifically for this 
    purpose. I'll be sure to remember these techniques for last time, as I struggled over both of them for 
    an embarassingly long time.

    Bonus note, I again ran into that bizarre exception type that only resolved when I restarted my computer.
    It does seem to only be a problem on my end. If you're interested, it was a TransportTimeoutException 
    (exit code: 256).
