Reflection:
===========
    This assignment was a relief, especially after the trials and tribulations
    of the last one. My biggest issue was figuring out how to use the Stacks
    in a meaningful and helpful way. I got stuck on a plan that would have easily
    been O(n^2) or O(n^3), but luckily I couldn't figure out how to actually make it
    work, so I had to scrap it and approach the issue from a different angle. After that
    most of my issues could be traced back to a single NullPointerException (and one
    ArrayOutOfBoundsException that I figured out quickly enough) that ended up originating
    from an ArrayList that I failed to initialize. Overall, this assignment was far easier
    than the last one, although it still proved enough of a challenge to feel worthwhile.

    The extra credit assignment was also fun, as I enjoyed revisiting the Scanner function.
    I ran into a bit of a snag when I couldn't figure out how to make the program take multiple
    lines of input at once, and I did have to rewrite almost all of my code to make it work,
    but I figured it out in the end. Sometimes, you just gotta delete everything and start over,
    and I'm kind of mad I didn't do it earlier, as I wasted waaaay too long trying to make unworkable
    code do something else, and when I finally caved and just rewrote it from scratch, I figured it
    out within fifteen minutes.
