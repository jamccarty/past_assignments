Reflection:
===========
    This assignment made me feel incredibly frustrated. That's all there is to it. I spent an embarassingly 
    long amoung of time trying to figure out a viable recursion solve() method using the pseudocode on the 
    website, but it seemed like no matter which way I turned, I kept on running into infinite loops. 
    Eventually, I just decided to say screw it and abandoned working from the pseudocode structure entirely. 
    I think the new method I ended up using is a lot more intuitive, and a lot less likely to give me an infinite 
    terminal, a chronically hot computer, or a half-filled-out, largely inaccurate "solved" sudoku puzzle. 
    I also ended up regretting putting everything in one gigantic class; however this was not
    enough to make me split it up into more several, more managably-sized ones, so take out of that what
    you will.
